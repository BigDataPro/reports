Description: reports is a package that assists in writing reports and
    presentations by providing a frame work that brings together existing R,
    LaTeX/.docx and Pandoc tools. The package is designed to be used with
    RStudio, MiKTex/Tex Live/LibreOffice, knitr, knitcitations, slidify, Pandoc
    and pander. The user will want to download these free programs/packages to
    maximize the effectiveness of the reports package.  Functions with two
    letter names are general text formatting functions for copying text from
    articles for quick formatting.  The cite family of functions allow quick
    pulling of quotes with citations (in Markdown or LaTeX format).
Note: Many functions in reports assume (a) you're using RStudio (b) the main
    report directory is set as the working directory.  While the default
    behavior is less flexible it increases efficiency.

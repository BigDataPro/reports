## Frequently Asked Questions

This FAQ is compiled from the [issues](https://github.com/trinker/reports/issues) and messages I received from blog posts and emails, etc.

1. **reports** does not work...
  - Please first update all your R packages (use `update.packages()`) and probably R itself ([what is the current R version?](http://cran.r-project.org/)), then see if it works; if not...
  - If this still does not fix the problem please file an [issue](https://github.com/trinker/reports/issues) report
1. What is the best place to ask questions when the [package website](http://trinker.github.io/reports/) or [vignette](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61803503/packages/reports_vignette.html) is not helpful?
  - Depending what you want to ask, you may use these tools (I keep track of the first three more frequently):
  - [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reports)(Recommended): general questions (more experts and quicker answers there).
  - [Github issues](https://github.com/trinker/reports/issues): bug reports and feature requests.
  - Email me at <a href="mailto:tyler.rinker@gmail.com" target="_blank">tyler.rinker@gmail.com</a> - this is the least recommended way unless this is really private issue.
1. How should I get started?
  - Watch the [intro video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArHQjQyIS70)
  - Look at the [qick start slides](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61803503/Slides/reports/index.html)
  - Read the [vignette](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61803503/packages/reports_vignette.html) on the [GitHub homepage](https://github.com/trinker/reports)
1. Do you recommend an editor for working with R and reports?
  - Hands down [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/).  The reports packages was designed to work with RStudio.
  - I also use [WinEdt](http://www.winedt.com/) for Windows and [TexMaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/). for Linux Mint, but I think the LaTeX editor you use should be comfortable to you.
1. How can I submit a documentation fix or other minor change?
  - Navigate to the file within the [repo](https://github.com/trinker/reports)

  - Make the necessary changes
  - Add a descriptive commit summary and click on **propose file change**
  - Submit the pull request

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# set global chunk options
library(knitr); library(knitcitations)

opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)
opts_chunk$set(fig.path = 'assets/fig/<%= group %>-')

#bib <- read.bibtex(file.path(getwd(), basename(getOption("bib.loc"))))
#cite in text using `r citet(bib[1])`
```

# Cylinder <%= group %>
## Setup

Set the path to save figures to be unique for each of the reports; otherwise unnamed chunks will get overwritten.

---

## Heat of cyl = <%= group %>

```{r message = F, fig.height = 5}
heatmap(as.matrix(mtcars[mtcars$cyl == <%= group %>, ]))
```

## What Next?

After you've developed a template run the functions in the brew.R file located in the main directory.

**Note:** *that you'd want to replace the pound signs in front of title, subtitle, and author and replace with a percent sign to use md2pdf*

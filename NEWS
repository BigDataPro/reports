reports 0.1.3
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `GQ`, `CA`, `LL` and `US` threw multiple warnings if a ligature was detected.
  This behavior has been corrected.

* `html5` would result in missing text when using the hanging indent code tags 
  `[[[]]]=hi`.  This behavior has been fixed.

NEW FEATURES


MINOR FEATURES

* `html5` and `reveal.js` out put now has a space between sections (slides)


IMPROVEMENTS

* `GQ`, `CA`, `LL` and `US` parse out both "fi" and "fl" ligatures more 
  effectively, whereas previously "fi" was assumed if a ligature was detected. 


CHANGES

* `GQ` did not handle block quotes correctly in what printed to the console.

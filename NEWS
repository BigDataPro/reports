reports 0.1.3
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `GQ`, `CA`, `LL` and `US` threw multiple warnings if a ligature was detected.
  This behavior has been corrected.

* `html5` would result in missing text when using the hanging indent code tags 
  `[[[]]]=hi`.  This behavior has been fixed.

* Previously all <li> were converted to fragments and [[[]]]=frag- remove <li>.  
  This resulted in an ability to specify and unfragmented list. (Fixes 
  #15 and #17)

NEW FEATURES


MINOR FEATURES

* `html5` and `reveal.js` out put now has a space between sections (slides)

* When initializing a prsentation .Rmd the date is dynamically set to use the 
  date of the `knit2html` call which of course can be set to be static.

IMPROVEMENTS

* `GQ`, `CA`, `LL` and `US` parse out both "fi" and "fl" ligatures more 
  effectively, whereas previously "fi" was assumed if a ligature was detected. 


CHANGES

reports 0.1.2
----------------------------------------------------------------
This is a bug fix release

BUG FIXES

* `GQ` did not handle block quotes correctly in what printed to the console.  
  This behavior has been corrected.

* `GQ`, `CA`, `LL` and `US` now parse out ligature "fi" as "fi" rather than "?".  
  Warnings were added for cases when liigatures are detected.

* Fixed the Description file for the basic_web template (missing info).

* `reveal.js` resulted in an error if a reference page was not supplied.   This 
  behavior has been corrected.

  the installr package

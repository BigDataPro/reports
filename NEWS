  assumes the location of the local image file is in "assets/img/", menaing the 
  user only needs supply the name of the local image.

IMPROVEMENTS

* `GQ`, `CA`, `LL` and `US` parse out both "fi" and "fl" ligatures more 
  effectively, whereas previously "fi" was assumed if a ligature was detected.

* `new_report` now allows global options to be set that allows numeric values to 
  be passed to the template option like speed dial. See ?new_report for more.


CHANGES

* `html5` and `reveal.js` are now Deprecated.  The birth of the slidify package 
  makes maintaining these functions pointless.  These functions will be removed 
  from the reports package upon the next update.

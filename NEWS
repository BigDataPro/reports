reports 0.1.3
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `GQ`, `CA`, `LL` and `US` threw multiple warnings if a ligature was detected.
  This behavior has been corrected.

* `html5` would result in missing text when using the hanging indent code tags 
  `[[[]]]=hi`.  This behavior has been fixed.

* Previously all <li> were converted to fragments and [[[]]]=frag- remove <li>.  
  This resulted in an ability to specify and unfragmented list. (Fixes 
  #15 and #17)

* Previously the user could not specify the background color (via `[[[]]]=bg`) in
  `reveal.js`.  This has been fixed.

NEW FEATURES

* `CN` a new function that wraps text with courier new HTML a font tag for 
  supplied text.

* `FT` a new function that detects face, color and size and generates a font tag 
  for supplied text.

MINOR FEATURES

* `html5` and `reveal.js` out put now has a space between sections (slides)

* When initializing a prsentation .Rmd the date is dynamically set to use the 
  date of the `knit2html` call which of course can be set to be static (Yihui Xie).

* The colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet and brown are now 
  available as background colors for `reveal.js`.

IMPROVEMENTS

* `GQ`, `CA`, `LL` and `US` parse out both "fi" and "fl" ligatures more 
  effectively, whereas previously "fi" was assumed if a ligature was detected.
